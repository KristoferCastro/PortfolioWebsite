					Software Engineering is an amazing art; requirements gathering,
					communicating with clients, designing the software, choosing technologies,
					programming an implementation, testing, and deployment.
					</br></br>
					Aside from my work and academic projects, I have a lot of WIP side projects like a meeting scheduler,
					pet feed application, and a 2D game I am working on.

					<p>
						Designing the GUI of an application is one of my favorite
						part in software development.  I enjoy using graphite pencils to create "throw-away" prototype
						designs and using graphic tools like Photoshop to do more
						finished design before implementation.

					<p>
						Every project, academic or work, I take it on my self to make sure
						my group and I have the software tools and technologies we need to
						develop a software.  
						<br><br>
						I use books, official documentations, youtube tutorials,
						and asking other developers to obtain knowledge.

						<h1>Problem Solver</h1>
					</header>
					<p>
						Some people like to solve crosswords, sudoku, or play some puzzle games
						like Angry Birds.  Me, I enjoy algorithmic problems centered around
						finding a solution that is space and time efficient.  I even have a glass white-board in my room
						that I use to sort out my thoughts.  My never-ending goal is to improve my problem solving abilities
						as it is the core of software engineering.

						<h1>Active</h1>

					<p>
						We developers probably spend an unhealthy amount of time infront of a computer.  
						I try to keep active by playing basketball, training at my local boxing gym, go hiking, and
						do weekly joggings.

						One of my motives that got me studying Computing Science is my technological curiosity on how 
						the games I played growing up were made.  I currently play Dota 2.
